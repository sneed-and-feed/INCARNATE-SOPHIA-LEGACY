### [Dicke Superradiance in Extended 2D Quantum Arrays Coupled to Metasurface Bound States in the Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04627v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-04T14:57:58Z

> Dicke superradiance is a collective phenomenon where the emission from ensembles of quantum emitters is coherently enhanced beyond the sum of each emitter's independent emission. Here, we propose a platform that exploits the delocalised nature of a high-Q, non-local mode supported by a dielectric metasurface (a so-called bound-state-in-the-continuum or BIC) to induce superradiant behaviour within an extended two-dimensional array of distant quantum emitters. We show that these BIC-mediated emitt...

### [Entanglement improves coordination in distributed systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04588v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-04T14:14:41Z

> Coordination in distributed systems is often hampered by communication latency, which degrades performance. Quantum entanglement offers fundamentally stronger correlations than classically achievable without communication. Crucially, these correlations manifest instantaneously upon measurement, irrespective of the physical distance separating the systems. We investigate the application of shared entanglement to a dual-work optimization problem in a distributed system comprising two servers. The ...

### [Enhancing Quantum Diffusion Models for Complex Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03405v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-03T11:32:19Z

> Quantum generative models offer a novel approach to exploring high-dimensional Hilbert spaces but face significant challenges in scalability and expressibility when applied to multi-modal distributions. In this study, we explore a Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net architecture integrated with Adaptive Non-Local Observables (ANO) as a potential solution to these hurdles. By compressing classical data into a dense quantum latent space and utilizing trainable observables, our model aims to extract non...
